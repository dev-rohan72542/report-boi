## Plan: Fix Theme and Lucid Icons in Light Mode

**Task:** The theme and Lucid icons are currently appearing white even in light mode, which makes them invisible. This plan outlines the steps to diagnose and fix this issue.

**1. Inspect the Code:**
   - Examine `components/theme-provider.tsx` to understand how the theme is being applied.
   - Review `app/globals.css` and any other relevant CSS files to check for conflicting styles.

**2. Identify the Faulty Code:**
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect the icon elements and identify the CSS rules that are making them white.
   - Pinpoint the exact lines of code or configuration that need to be changed.

**3. Implement the Fix:**
   - Modify the CSS or theme configuration to ensure that the icons have a dark color in light mode and a light color in dark mode.
   - This may involve adding or removing CSS variables or adjusting the theme settings.

**4. Test the Changes:**
   - Manually test the application in both light and dark modes to confirm that the icons are now visible and correctly styled.
   - Verify that the fix does not have any unintended side effects on other parts of the application.
