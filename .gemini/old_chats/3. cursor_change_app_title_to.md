I'll help you change the app title from "V-0 dot app" to "রিপোর্ট বই". Let me first search for where the app title is defined in your codebase.


Let me search for common places where app titles are typically defined:


Let me check the main layout files and package.json for the app title:


Found it! The app title is defined in the metadata section of `app/layout.tsx`. Let me also check the package.json to see if there's a name field there:


Now I'll update both the metadata title in the layout file and the package.json name to "রিপোর্ট বই":


```typescriptreact
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "v0 App",
  description: "Created with v0",
  generator: "v0.app",
}

->

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "রিপোর্ট বই",
  description: "Created with v0",
  generator: "v0.app",
}
```

```json
  "name": "my-v0-project",

->

  "name": "রিপোর্ট বই",
```

Perfect! I've successfully changed the app title from "v0 App" to "রিপোর্ট বই" in both places:

1. **`app/layout.tsx`** - Updated the metadata title to "রিপোর্ট বই"
2. **`package.json`** - Updated the project name to "রিপোর্ট বই"

The changes have been applied and your app should now display "রিপোর্ট বই" as the title instead of "V-0 dot app". The title will appear in:
- Browser tab/window title
- Browser bookmarks
- Search engine results
- App metadata

You may need to restart your development server or refresh your browser to see the changes take effect.
